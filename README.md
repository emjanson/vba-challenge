Code file name: StockCalculationsEMJ.vbs

The code file in this repository is a VBA script comprised of 3 subroutines. One subroutine that calculates the total trading volume for each individual stock and the greatest total trading volume across all stocks in a worksheet; one subroutine that calculates the change in stock price from start of opening day to the end of closing day for each indivual stock (with conditional formatting for positive and negative price change values), the percent change for the year for each indiviudal stock in a worksheet, and the greatest percent increase and decrease in stock price across all stocks in the worksheet; and finally, one subroutine that calls both calculation subroutines for any worksheet that contains data. 

*Code sourcing statement*
-----------------------

 I did use a natural language description of the desired script's functions entered into ChatGPT 3.5 to help build the code structure. I did copy and paste pieces of that code in order to be more efficient, but I tailored it to fit all of the desired functions of this paricular project (plus try to add some potential error checking and workarounds). I did not directly copy and paste any of this code from the internet otherwise (e.g., from StackExchange or any other webpage). I did not seek any assistance or use code written by my peers or instructors for this challenge.

End of code sourcing statement.

Also contained in the repository are three screen shots of the results of running the script on the example workbook comprised of 3 years worth of stock price and trade volume data.
